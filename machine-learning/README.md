# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the machine learning projects directory of my data science repository! ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

This directory houses a collection of machine learning projects, each designed to explore various datasets, build predictive models, and uncover valuable insights. From predicting TTC subway delays to classifying music genres, each project offers a unique perspective on the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems.

## Projects

Here's a list of machine learning projects available in this directory:

1. [**Asteroid Hazard Classification:**](asteroid-hazard-classification) Classifying potential hazards posed by asteroids for planetary defense efforts.

2. [**Music Genre Classification:**](music-genre-classification) Classifying music genres using machine learning techniques, uncovering patterns in audio data.

3. [**Pulsar Star Classification:**](pulsar-star-classification) Identifying pulsar stars through classification analysis, contributing to astronomical discoveries.

4. [**TTC Subway Delay Prediction:**](ttc-subway-delay-prediction) Predicting TTC subway delays to enhance commuter experiences.
