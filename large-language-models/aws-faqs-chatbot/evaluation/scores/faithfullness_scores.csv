4,"Feedback: The response correctly asserts that RIs provide a capacity reservation, which is directly supported by the provided context. The response also explains how to take advantage of this capacity reservation, which is not directly supported but can be inferred from the context.",Q: Do RIs provide a capacity reservation?,"['If you want to take advantage of the capacity reservation, then you should buy an RI in a specific AZ.']"," A: Yes, RIs do provide a capacity reservation. As per the context, to take advantage of the capacity reservation, one should buy a Reserved Instance (RI) in a specific Availability Zone (AZ)."
2,"Feedback: The response correctly states that root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes when a system terminates. However, it incorrectly states that memory (RAM) contents are stored on the EBS root volume, when in fact they are not saved at all. The response does not provide information about the memory contents contradicting the context, but it is still a mistake.",Q: What happens to my data when a system terminates?,"['As with the Stop feature, root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes.

5,"Feedback: The response indicates that an Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) can be used to identify the location of a resource across accounts, which is consistent with the context. The context also mentions that an AZ ID provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all accounts, and that it makes it easier for resources to be provisioned centrally in a single account and shared across multiple accounts. The response directly supports these claims, demonstrating a high degree of faithfulness to the provided context.","Q: How can I communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with another account, given AZ name mappings could be different across AWS accounts?",['You can now use an Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) instead of an AZ name. An AZ ID is a static reference and provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all your accounts. This makes it easier for you to provision resources centrally in a single account and share them across multiple accounts.'],"
