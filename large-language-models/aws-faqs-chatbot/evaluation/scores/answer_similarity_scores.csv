5,"Feedback: The response correctly identifies that Spot Fleet requests can be tagged during creation, and also clarifies that the Spot Fleet itself cannot be tagged. This is semantically similar to the reference answer, which states that Spot Instances can be launched with tags via Spot Fleet, and that the Fleet itself cannot be tagged.",Q. Can I tag a Spot Fleet request?,['You can request to launch Spot Instances with tags via Spot Fleet. The Fleet by itself cannot be tagged.']," Yes, you can tag a Spot Fleet request when you create it. However, the Spot Fleet itself cannot be tagged."
5,"Feedback: The provided response, 'You can learn more about Amazon EFS by visiting the Amazon EFS FAQ page.', has a high degree of semantic similarity to the reference answer, 'You can visit the Amazon EFS FAQ pageAmazon EFS FAQ page.'. Both provide the same information and direct the user to the Amazon EFS FAQ page.",Q: Where can I learn more about EFS?,['You can visit the Amazon EFS FAQ pageAmazon EFS FAQ page.'],"

5,"Feedback: The response is semantically similar to the reference answer, both indicating that RIs provide a capacity reservation and suggesting buying an RI in a specific AZ to take advantage of this feature.",Q: Do RIs provide a capacity reservation?,"['If you want to take advantage of the capacity reservation, then you should buy an RI in a specific AZ.']"," A: Yes, RIs do provide a capacity reservation. As per the context, to take advantage of the capacity reservation, one should buy a Reserved Instance (RI) in a specific Availability Zone (AZ)."
2,"Feedback: The response correctly mentions that root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes when a system terminates, aligning with the reference answer. However, the response states that memory (RAM) contents are not saved, while the reference answer states that they are stored on the EBS root volume. Although both mention memory, they contradict each other.",Q: What happens to my data when a system terminates?,"['As with the Stop feature, root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes. Memory (RAM) contents are stored on the EBS root volume.']","
    When a system terminates, the root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes. However, memory (RAM) contents are not saved. Therefore, any data stored in the memory will be lost."
4,"Feedback: The response affirms that Previous Generation instances can still be used and added, which is correct. However, it also states that Reserved Instances will not change, which is not mentioned in the question. The reference answer, on the other hand, clearly states that Previous Generation instances are not going away. While the response is generally in line with the reference answer, it introduces an unnecessary detail and fails to mirror the exact phrasing of the reference answer.",Q: Can I still use/add more Previous Generation instances?,"['No. Your Reserved Instances will not change, and the Previous Generation instances are not going away.']"," Yes, you can still use and add more Previous Generation instances. They are not going away."
4,"Feedback: The response correctly identifies that Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) can be used to communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation across accounts. The response further explains that an AZ ID provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all accounts, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the response does not explicitly mention that AZ name mappings could be different across AWS accounts, which is a minor point that was mentioned in the question.","Q: How can I communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with another account, given AZ name mappings could be different across AWS accounts?",['You can now use an Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) instead of an AZ name. An AZ ID is a static reference and provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all your accounts. This makes it easier for you to provision resources centrally in a single account and share them across multiple accounts.'],"

4,"Feedback: The response accurately describes the difference between G3 and P2 instances, mentioning the specific GPU models, application types, and capabilities. However, it lacks the mention of the number of monitors each M60 GPU in G3 instances supports and the networking bandwidth in P2 instances.",Q: How are G3 instances different from P2 instances?,"['G3 instances use NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs and provide a high-performance platform for graphics applications using DirectX or OpenGL. NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs support NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation features, and H.265 (HEVC) hardware encoding. Each M60 GPU in G3 instances supports 4 monitors with resolutions up to 4096x2160, and is licensed to use NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation for one Concurrent Connected User. Example applications of G3 instances include 3D visualizations, graphics-intensive remote workstation, 3D rendering, application streaming, video encoding, and other server-side graphics workloads. P2 instances use NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs and are designed for general purpose GPU computing using the CUDA or OpenCL programming models. P2 instances provide customers with high bandwidth 25 Gbps networking, powerful single and double precision floating-point capabilities, and error-correcting code (ECC) memory, making them ideal for deep learning, high performance databases, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, molecular modeling, genomics, rendering, and other server-side GPU compute workloads.']","
