They are not going away."
5,"Feedback: The response accurately explains how to communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with another account using the Availability Zone ID (AZ ID). The explanation is clear, detailed, and closely matches the provided target, showing a high degree of semantic similarity. The provided response does not contain any discrepancies, inaccuracies or omissions.","Q: How can I communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with another account, given AZ name mappings could be different across AWS accounts?",['You can now use an Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) instead of an AZ name. An AZ ID is a static reference and provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all your accounts. This makes it easier for you to provision resources centrally in a single account and share them across multiple accounts.'],"
