Q: Do RIs provide a capacity reservation?," A: Yes, RIs do provide a capacity reservation. As per the context, to take advantage of the capacity reservation, one should buy a Reserved Instance (RI) in a specific Availability Zone (AZ).","['If you want to take advantage of the capacity reservation, then you should buy an RI in a specific AZ.']",3.89
Q: What happens to my data when a system terminates?,"
    When a system terminates, the root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes. However, memory (RAM) contents are not saved. Therefore, any data stored in the memory will be lost.","['As with the Stop feature, root device and attached device data are stored on the corresponding EBS volumes.

Q: Can I still use/add more Previous Generation instances?," Yes, you can still use and add more Previous Generation instances. They are not going away.","['No. Your Reserved Instances will not change, and the Previous Generation instances are not going away.']",1.03
"Q: How can I communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with another account, given AZ name mappings could be different across AWS accounts?","
    You can communicate the AZ of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with another account using the Availability Zone ID (AZ ID). An AZ ID is a static reference that provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all your accounts. This makes it easier for you to provision resources centrally in a single account and share them across multiple accounts.",['You can now use an Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) instead of an AZ name. An AZ ID is a static reference and provides a consistent way of identifying the location of a resource across all your accounts. This makes it easier for you to provision resources centrally in a single account and share them across multiple accounts.'],2.14

Q: How are G3 instances different from P2 instances?,"
    G3 instances are optimized for high-performance graphics applications using DirectX or OpenGL, while P2 instances are designed for general purpose GPU computing using the CUDA or OpenCL programming models. G3 instances support NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation features and H.265 (HEVC) hardware encoding, and are ideal for 3D visualizations, graphics-intensive remote workstation, 3D rendering, application streaming, video encoding, and other server-side graphics workloads. On the other hand, P2 instances provide high bandwidth networking, powerful floating-point capabilities, and ECC memory, making them suitable for deep learning, high performance databases, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, molecular modeling, genomics, rendering, and other server-side GPU compute workloads.","['G3 instances use NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs and provide a high-performance platform for graphics applications using DirectX or OpenGL. NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs support NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation features, and H.265 (HEVC) hardware encoding. Each M60 GPU in G3 instances supports 4 monitors with resolutions up to 4096x2160, and is licensed to use NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation for one Concurrent Connected User. Example applications of G3 instances include 3D visualizations, graphics-intensive remote workstation, 3D rendering, application streaming, video encoding, and other server-side graphics workloads. P2 instances use NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs and are designed for general purpose GPU computing using the CUDA or OpenCL programming models. P2 instances provide customers with high bandwidth 25 Gbps networking, powerful single and double precision floating-point capabilities, and error-correcting code (ECC) memory, making them ideal for deep learning, high performance databases, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, molecular modeling, genomics, rendering, and other server-side GPU compute workloads.']",7.15
Q: How much disk throughput can Dense-storage and HDD-storage instances deliver?,6.2 GiB/s read and 6.2 GiB/s write disk throughput with a 128k block size.,"['The largest current generation of Dense HDD-storage instances, d3en.12xlarge, can deliver up to 6.2 GiB/s read and 6.2 GiB/s write disk throughput with a 128k block size. Please see the product detail page for additional performance information. To ensure the best disk throughput performance from your D2, D3 and D3en instances on Linux, we recommend that you use the most recent version of the Amazon Linux AMI, or another Linux AMI with a kernel version of 3.8 or later that supports persistent grantsâ€”an extension to the Xen block ring protocol that significantly improves disk throughput and scalability.']",1.23
